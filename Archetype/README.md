>>Xylem Open Source Projection Software

This is open source software being worked on by Gabe Markarian for Independent Study work being done at UMass Amherst in association with Prof. Rick Harper

In this archetype edition, a useful skeleton is provided in the hopes of making future versions of Xylem easier to understand and fabricate.  Most methods and variable are left blank, this version stands as simply a way to grasp one possible working control flow but additions and modifications are encouraged.

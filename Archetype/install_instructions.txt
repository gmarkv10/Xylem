1. Set up a directory called C:\installers (or some other name of your
choice).

2. Download xlrd-0.7.1.zip from PyPI into that directory.

3. Unzip it so that you get C:\installers\xlrd-0.7.1\etc etc

4. Start up a Command Prompt window, and then do:

    prompt> cd C:\installers\xlrd-0.7.1
    prompt> c:\Python27\python setup.py install

The last line above assumes that you are using Python 2.7 and have
installed it in the default location ... if not, adjust accordingly.

I'm doing some research on how to provide an installer (a .msi file,
probably that will work on 64-bit Windows; in the meantime, the above
should get you going.

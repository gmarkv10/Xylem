# Xylem
##Xylem Open Source Projection Software

>Created for Research in Amherst, MA

###Amherst
The original program preceding the Xylem structure using synthesized growth rates from i-Tree Design and the Town of Amherst tree inventory.

###AmherstOakProject
The final program in the Amherst case study projecting 48 research oak spp. with i-Tree Design-based growth rates.

###Archetype
Includes the blank Xylem file from which future projects can be based. Documentation on starting a new project with growth rate data and an inventory can be found here.
>Starting to work with Xylem from scratch?
Install notes on Python 2.7 and the xlrd and xlwt packages can be found here!

###ToA Comparison
Two comparable programs that use the two unique projection methods from ***Using Flexible Open-Source Programs to Estimate Future Projections of Urban Tree Benefits: A Case Study in Amherst, MA.*** as well as relevant i-Tree Streets files.

###UMass
Second projection program written by the author and the first to be given the Xylem moniker. This iteration employs Coder's annual percentage growth information and performs projections on the UMass tree inventory.
